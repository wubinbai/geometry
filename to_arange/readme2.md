Project for CS313E; Defines classes for point, line, and circle including appropriate geometric functions.

#using the text file Geometry.py reads in geometry.txt for the creation of points, lines, and circles. Lines 1-6 contain the (x) and (y) locations of points P, Q, A, B, G, and H. Lines 7-8 contain the radius and coordinates of the center of a circle. Comments on each line are ignored by the program.

#understanding the output The main function checks various things about the relationships of each point, line, and circle. The output was formatted according to guidelines provided by the instructor of the class.

#future improvements In redesigning the file for more universal use, a function to interpret each line and appropriately create a line, point, or circle based on the contents would be necessary. Other geometric relations can be defined within each class, and other shapes could be created.
